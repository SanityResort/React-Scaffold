# React-Scaffold

## Intention

Project skeleton using:

- Webpack 4
- TypeScript 2
- React 16
- SASS

This is bascially my personal react scaffold that I spent several days figuring out how to set up. Feel free to use it if it suits your needs.

Improvements and comments are always welcome.

## Features

- Hot reload with webpack dev server on localhost:3000
- sass files transformed to separate css files
- asset files automatically referenced with chunkhashes
- minified asset files for production build

## Usage

- clone this repo
- change name in package.json to match project folder
- ```npm update --dev``` to initially install all node modules in up to date versions
- ```npm start``` for dev mode with hot reload
- ```npm install``` to build prod files in ```dist``` folder
